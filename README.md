## What is it?

This project contains a number of simple language modeling tools. The tools contained
in the toolkit are meant to be used for rapid prototypes for applications and services
running on a single machine (for highly distributed environments, please see other 
projects such as [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/)). The toolkit is designed to 
be easy to use and understand in order to get you up and performing language analyses
within minutes.
