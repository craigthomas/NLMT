/**
 * Sample a probability mass function. Each sample has a weight associated
 * with it that represents the mass of the sample. The sampler works by
 * collecting all of the weights. When <code>sample()</code> is called,
 * it chooses a random number between 0 and the total sum of all the
 * weights. It returns the index of the sample that the randomly chosen
 * number falls between.
 *
 * For example, assume that the sampler was given the weights [1.2, 0.5, 0.1].
 * The total sum of all the weights is 1.8. It would then draw a random number
 * between 0 and 1.8 and compare it to the following values:
 *
 * Sample 1 - index 0 - must be > 0.0 and <= 1.2
 * Sample 2 - index 1 - must be > 1.2 and <= 1.7
 * Sample 3 - index 2 - must be > 1.7 and <= 1.8
 *
 * If the random value drawn was 1.543, then index 1 would be returned.
